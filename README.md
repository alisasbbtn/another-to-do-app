# Another To-Do App

This is a small to-do app (as the name states) to practice React while learning with this course on Udemy: [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Uses CSS Modules with Sass, Redux with Redux Thunk, Axios, Firebase Realtime Database. Plus some fancy Ionicons.

---

### What I've practiced:
* Using `axios` 
* Using Firebase Realtime Database
* Using React State, then moved to `redux` with `redux-thunk`

### Planning to:
* Add signing in, signing up, auth
* Practice React routing
* Add some tests
* Replace Redux Thunk with Redux Saga
* Add fancy React animations
* Deploy it somewhere
* Clone repository and rewrite everything in React Hooks
